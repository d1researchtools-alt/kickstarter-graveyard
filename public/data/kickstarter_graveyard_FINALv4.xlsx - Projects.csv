ZionEyez Eyez," $ 343,415 ","2,106"," $ 55,000 ",2011-07-31,2012-04-15,Technology/Wearables,"Seattle team promised HD video recording glasses with Facebook streaming by Winter 2011. Last substantive update April 2012. Rebranded to 'Zeyez' claiming partnership delays. Photo of founders on Thailand beach surfaced after funding. Backers formed 'ZionKick' forum calling it scam. No products ever delivered to any of 2,106 backers.

Product Development Failure Reason: Attempted to build Google Glass-equivalent product with undergraduate team on $343K budget. Underestimated engineering complexity of miniaturizing HD camera, WiFi, battery into eyeglass frame.

Key battery component discontinued mid-project requiring custom solution. Manufacturing yield only 55% - cost per unit ballooned to $260+ vs $129 pledge. Flextronics manufacturing partner walked away. Only 80 units shipped of 8,243 owed. Filed bankruptcy May 2016 with $30K assets vs $891,563 liabilities.

Product Development Failure Reason: Extreme form factor (0.8mm) required custom battery solution when supplier discontinued component. 55% manufacturing yield made unit economics impossible ($260 cost vs $129 pledge). Design prioritized thinness over manufacturability.","MANUFACTURABILITY, SUPPLY-CHAIN, SCALE-UP",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1655017763/cst-01-the-worlds-thinnest-watch,https://www.slashgear.com/cst-01-kickstarter-thinnest-watch-maker-goes-bankrupt-02438668/,https://www.pcworld.com/article/417926/cst-01-kickstarter-thin-watch.html

Two years after promised December 2013 delivery, 5,685 backers still empty-handed. Secret Labs sold Netduino brand to Wilderness Labs December 2016. Backers organized legal action via FundedJustice. No watches ever delivered.

Product Development Failure Reason: Hardware/software partnership between Secret Labs and House of Horology broke down over manufacturing disputes. Neither party had full product development capability alone. Project management failures cited by backers who investigated.","MANUFACTURABILITY, SYSTEM-INTEGRATION",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/secretlabs/agent-the-worlds-smartest-watch,https://www.wareable.com/smartwatches/meet-the-kickstarter-crusader-martin-calsyn,https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/16/backed-or-whacked-driving-an-agent-of-smartwatch-change/

Raised additional $2M from investors but still failed. Only 40% of backers received printers, many defective.

Product Development Failure Reason: Recent graduates with no manufacturing experience promised $347 printer competing with $2,200 Makerbot. Price point made profitable manufacturing impossible.

Shipped 10 months late with severe hardware/software issues - voice/gesture controls didn't work, couldn't keep time. Company deleted negative reviews, changed T&Cs to deny refunds. Closed 2014.

Product Development Failure Reason: Zero engineers on staff - entire team was marketing. No working prototype at campaign launch. Outsourced to ODM (Viewcooper) with no oversight. Speaker holes muffled audio. Waterproof claim failed on shower. Battery: 24hr vs 7-day claim. Watch couldn't keep time without Bluetooth.

Co-founder David Boe embezzled $320K to build personal house. Grayston discovered theft in 2014, kept quiet hoping for repayment. Only $111K recovered. Police investigation launched. Company collapsed May 2016. Zero printers shipped to any of 4,420 backers despite reaching 70% completion on first 600 units.

No working prototype - only CGI renders. Promised April 2014 delivery, went silent for 9+ months, then promised ""working prototype"" in 2015. Never delivered any product to backers.

Product Development Failure Reason: Ring form factor couldn't house sufficient battery for claimed features. Bluetooth, LED display, vibration motor couldn't fit in ring size. Thermal issues with electronics at skin contact.

Company sold coolers on Amazon for $450+ while 20,000+ backers waited. Oregon DOJ investigation led to 2017 settlement. Tariff increases on Chinese imports proved fatal. Shut down December 2019 with 20,000+ of 62,642 backers never receiving product. Regarded as Kickstarter's largest failure.

Product Development Failure Reason: Feature-packed design ($185 pledge) had bill of materials exceeding sale price. Tariffs on Chinese manufacturing added 25% to costs.

Founders Marcus & Mitchell Weller sued for using funds as ""personal piggy bank"" - luxury cars, trips, strip clubs. Only ~200 of 3,300 helmets shipped. Chapter 7 bankruptcy Aug 2016. Backers got nothing.

Product Development Failure Reason: DFM issues with electronics during production ramp required complete mainboard redesign. Failed EMC testing, forcing FCC re-certification.

Technology physically impossible - pico projector cannot project visible image in daylight at that angle. Founders used fake names, claimed San Francisco but were in Ukraine. Never delivered any product.

Product Development Failure Reason: Projection onto skin required laser/projector technology too large for watch form factor. Physics of pico projection at claimed brightness impossible at device size. Photoshopped marketing images.

Promotional video was faked using a DJI Inspire drone. Over-ambitious stretch goals and financial mismanagement led to collapse.

Product Development Failure Reason: Promotional video faked using DJI Inspire. Stretch goals (thermal imaging, facial recognition) exceeded team capability. Propellers from China failed testing.

Unibody design required unreliable custom components. Only ~4,000 units shipped before company entered 'hibernation mode' in February 2017.

Promotional video faked using GoPro on DJI drones. SF DA filed fraud lawsuit. Company shut down January 2017, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Most backers never received refunds.

Product Development Failure Reason: Camera hardware produced subpar footage (blurry, color off). 'Throw and go' auto-stabilization unreliable.

Used misleading CGI in promotional video. H+ Technology used fake accounts to boost campaign. Kickstarter declined to remove despite documented misrepresentation.

Product Development Failure Reason: Marketed as '3D holographic display' but was just Pepper's Ghost - 19th century 2D reflection trick.

Indiegogo page shows ""awaiting update"" for years.

Product Development Failure Reason: Kickstarter suspended for no working prototype. Laser filament could only cut 1-2 hairs at a time. Filament fragile and prone to breaking. Desktop-sized circuit board couldn't fit in razor form factor. Prototype videos possibly faked with heated nichrome wire. Still not delivered 9+ years later.","NO-PROTOTYPE, PHYSICS-IMPOSSIBLE",https://web.archive.org/web/20220417015713/https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-skarp-laser-razor-21st-century-shaving-new-health ,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skarp_Technologies ,https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/13/9518163/laser-razor-kickstarter-banned-indiegogo

Spent $2.8M on R&D, ran out of funds. Company liquidated August 2019.

Product Development Failure Reason: Modular connector system couldn't maintain reliable electrical connections. Thermal management issues with stacked modules.
